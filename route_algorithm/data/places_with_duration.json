DO NOT attend if you have no interest in mystics or spirituality - most kids and adults fell asleep.

The way the information about dancing is displayed within the centre is also good in my opinion. The layout for the stage also makes you feel quite close to the action.\n\nMoving on to the Sufi/Dervish show, the show was terrible. Its boring and a waste of time and it was most likely one of the worst shows I have ever watched. I fell asleep during the show multiple times and I was sitting in the front row. My disappointment comes from the fact that I've seen multiple Sufi shows in Egypt and Turkey. There are better shows in Istanbul, don't go to the Sufi show here, it isn't worth your time or money. Thankfully, this show is held as a separate event from the other dance show held here. \n\nNow, to the last part. The Turkish dance show is simply great, its energetic, it fun and simply worth going to. Its great value for money, and a decent way to either or end or start the night.",

As you sit down to watch your environment,  people selling water(1TL), tea or coffee will offer everyone for 3TL. One evening  as I was sitting on a bench drinking tea, I was approached by a 25 year old man, he started to talk very respectfully so I didn't mind a conversation until he started to flirt. Perfect if that is what you are looking for. \nI have seen some Turkish guys pretending to be Spanish which I am, to a Korean tourist trying to take him for drinks.  It was a bit strange and I would be careful.  If you have any problems,  talk to the police, present all over the square.\nAmazing restaurants offering homemade Turkish food for around 32TL (food, drink and bread). The restaurant is called Can.

It is part of an ancient Greek sacrificial tripod, originally in Delphi and relocated to Constantinople by Constantine the Great in AD 324. It was built to commemorate the Greeks who fought and defeated the Persian Empire at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. The serpent heads remained intact until the end of the 17th century, its provenance is almost 2,500 years old. Together with its original golden tripod and cauldron (both long missing), it constituted a trophy, or offering reminding of a military victory, dedicated to Apollo at Delphi. This offering was made in 478 BC, several months after the defeat of the Persian army in the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC by those Greek city-states during the Greco-Persian Wars.",

It is set, with other monuments up in the middle of the Hippodrome also dubbed the spina. The Serpent Column, known in the old days as the Tripod of Plataea, celebrated the victory of the Greeks over the Persians during the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. It was moved from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and set in middle of the Hippodrome. The top was adorned with a golden bowl supported by three serpent heads. We don\u2019t see the heads anymore; however some parts of the heads were recovered and are displayed at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. In fact, they report that the serpent heads and top third of the column were destroyed in 1700. Nonetheless, it is a charming place to visit while in Istanbul. With or without a guide, just raise your head and breathe, all the history is in the air. Instagram @profnasr",

Recently renovated, the calm, quiet beauty of the mosque is complemented by a small terraced garden, with fabulous views overlooking the Bosporus. Following the death of S\u00fcleiman the Magnificent\u2019s son, \u015eehzade Cihangir (1531-1553) Mimar Sinan, the great Ottoman architect, was commissioned to build a wooden mosque on the site (1559), in memory of \u015eehzade Cihangir (and, possibly, his brother, Mehmet), hence giving rise to the neighbourhood\u2019s (mahalle) name. The mosque suffered damage in many different fires, as it was wooden, with the latest rebuilding being under Abd\u00fclhamid II in 1889. Originally a smaller copy of Sinan\u2019s Mihrimah Sultan mosque in Edirne, the current square plan, single-dome retains the signature feature of the great architect\u2019s work, being filled with light through large windows, though the original decoration and much else is gone. The associated medresse (religious school) has also long since disappeared under mid-20th century residential development. Because of its location, Cihangir Cami\u2019i is one of the most visible landmarks on the heights of Pera, especially from the Bosporus.",

The complex is the oldest surviving Turkish architectural structure built in Istanbul, and further gives its name to the neighborhood around it in the city's\u00a0Beykoz\u00a0district.\nAnadoluhisar\u0131 was built between 1393 and 1394 on the commission of the\u00a0OttomanSultan\u00a0Bayezid I, as part of his preparations for a siege on the then-Byzantine\u00a0city of\u00a0Constantinople, the naval blockade of which took place in 1395 under Bayezid's orders.\n\nConstructed on an area of 7,000 square metres (1.7 acres), the fortress is situated at the narrowmost point of the\u00a0Bosporus, where the strait is a mere 660 meters (2,170\u00a0ft) wide. The site is bound by G\u00f6ksu (Ancient Greek:\u00a0Aret\u00f2s) creek to the south, and was previously home to the ruins of a\u00a0Roman\u00a0temple dedicated to\u00a0Uranus.[2]\u00a0Erected primarily as a watch fort, the citadel has a 25 meters (82\u00a0ft) tall, quadratic main tower within the walls of an irregular pentagon, with five watchtowers at the corners.\n\nAfter Bayezid's campaign was first interrupted by the\u00a0Crusade of Nicopolis, and then the\u00a0Battle of Ankara, an 11-year\u00a0period of turmoiltook hold of the Ottomans, which ended with the ascent of\u00a0Mehmed I\u00a0to the throne. His grandson, Sultan\u00a0Mehmed II\u00a0reinforced the fortress with a two-meter-thick wall and three additional watchtowers, and added further extensions, including a warehouse and living quarters. As part of his plans to launch a renewed military campaign to conquer Constantinople, Mehmed II further built a sister structure to Anadoluhisar\u0131 across the Bosphorus called\u00a0Rumelihisar\u0131, and the two fortresses worked in tandem in 1453 to throttle all maritime traffic along the Bosphorus, thus helping the Ottomans achieve their goal of making the city of\u00a0Constantinople\u00a0(later renamed\u00a0Istanbul) their new imperial capital.\n\nAfter the\u00a0Ottoman conquest of the city, Anadoluhisar\u0131 served as a customs house and military prison, and after several centuries, fell into disrepair.\n\nAfter the\u00a0fall of the Ottomans\u00a0and the 1923 establishment of the\u00a0Republic of Turkey, the newly-created\u00a0Turkish Ministry of Culturetended to and ultimately restored the site in 1991 - 1993. Today, Anadoluhisar\u0131 lends a\u00a0picturesque\u00a0appearance to its corner of the Bosphorus alongside the timber\u00a0yal\u0131\u00a0homes that define the neighborhood, and functions as a historical site, although it is not open to the public.",

You have cash points and the tourist police 24/7. You can snack on some sweetcorn (5TL) or chestnuts (10TL to 30 TL) which are delicious.  As you sit down to watch your environment,  people selling water(1TL), tea or coffee will offer everyone for 3TL. One evening  as I was sitting on a bench drinking tea, I was approached by a 25 year old man, he started to talk very respectfully so I didn't mind a conversation until he started to flirt. Perfect if that is what you are looking for. \nI have seen some Turkish guys pretending to be Spanish which I am, to a Korean tourist trying to take him for drinks.  It was a bit strange and I would be careful.  If you have any problems,  talk to the police, present all over the square.\nAmazing restaurants offering homemade Turkish food for around 32TL (food, drink and bread). The restaurant is called Can. Other similar ones along the tram line.",

Visible damage caused by building on-top of the lost cistern can be seen in cracks in the columns and pathced holes in the ceiling of the area. An ultimately beautiful sight to take in and a perfect place to come during the hotter parts of the day. Take your time and explore each column individually, read the signs and take it all in.",

Really , they overcharge as prices are highly inflated compared to other sites and places. All items including, footwear, leather goods, bags and Jewellery, watches, etc can be found elsewhere within Istanbul, so haggle down to less than half the asking price or you will be definitely paying above the odds! But, all in all, you will need to allow a day or two or even more to properly explore shop and enjoy the experience. Be sure to explore the shopping around the edges of the market as they provide a better price overall. Just relax and enjoy the Grand Bazar ottoman experience.",

I did make some purchases, e.g. bought a 100% cotton white bathrobe for 70 TL, which is about $12. It wasn't your typical terry sort of material, it was the thin, waffle-stitched sort - less bulky and more absorbent. That was a great deal! I bought 8 pot/pan decorated coasters as souvenirs - look around until you find the merchants that sell them for 10 TL - there are some selling them for 15 and 20 TL.",
